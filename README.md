# Project Info
This project was made in partial fulfillment for the requirement of the award of **Training in Data Science,Machine Learning and AI using Python** for the *Project Based Summer Internship at iHUB DivyaSampark at IIT Roorkee and Diginique TechLabs*.

Guided by: Mr. Ashish Saini (Diginique TechLabs)

# Contents Info
- The jupyter notebook contains an assessment of commonly used regression algortihms,their training accuracies and some erreo metrics.

- The csv file is the data-set for used car re-selling price was downloaded from [here.](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/avikasliwal/used-cars-price-prediction?select=train-data.csv')

Further information about the data-set and alogrithms used are mentioned in the notebook.

# List of external librairies used :
- `pandas 2.0.3` : for data pre-processing.
- `sci-kit learn 1.3.0` : for data training models, error metrics ,and more.
- `matplotlib  3.7.2` : for visualisation of certain metrics via graph.

### Please note :
>It is recommended to use a virtual environment when using packages from `scikit learn`.

Please refer to the [scikit](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html) and [python](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) documentation for more information.
